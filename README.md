# :musical_note: Discord Music Bot :musical_note:
In this project, I set out to create a Discord music bot using JavaScript and Node.js, with the goal of learning how to integrate with APIs. I utilized libraries like Discord.js and discord-player to leverage Discord's powerful API capabilities.

Implementing features like responding to user commands and delivering music playback required me to employ asynchronous techniques like async/await promises. I also refined my skills in array methods, API integration, audio playback, debugging, and project structure best practices.

By building a fully-functional bot that interacts seamlessly with Discord's API, I gained valuable hands-on experience working with real-world APIs. Moving forward, I aim to expand on this foundation by optimizing performance, adding advanced capabilities, and potentially integrating additional platform APIs.

Overall, this project served as an engaging, practical way for me to improve my JavaScript proficiency and acquire core skills like asynchronous programming, API usage, and audio integration. I'm excited to apply what I've learned to create more sophisticated bots and applications in the future.
